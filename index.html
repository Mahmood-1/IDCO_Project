                    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                    <p>The Improvement and Development for Communities Centre (IDCO)  has been successful in attracting a large number of  high-value projects in recent years. Many of these projects are innovative and transformational in support of long term strategy. 
                        These projects are a welcome sign of our success and our investment for the future. It is vital that these pioneering projects are well managed by proficient Project Managers and by their teams and adequately supported by centre’s administrative support staff.
                        Due to the size and strategic importance of these projects, it is essential that we meet agreed timescales, budgets and levels of performance. Failure to do so can result in serious financial loss and damage to our reputation. Consequently, one of the most important and supported management processes in IDCO must be proficient 'project management'. 
                        IDCO has a number of internal departmental project management processes and these have evolved over time to meet the needs of targeted groups, stakeholders or budget holders. Many of these processes have served IDCO well, however the valuable, larger size and complexity of current projects has put a strain on these existing project management systems. Furthermore, the IDCO’s PMS supports the UN-Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
